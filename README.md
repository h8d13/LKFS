## Alpine-Mini Chroot ðŸ‘» 

> Prereqs: Be on a linux system with tar, wget, bash

Coolest part of this project: Initial auto download is **3.3mb.**

Extracted is < ~10mb, end goal being a kind of TUI-os.

Then the limit is your imagination as always.

Which makes it so that the host doesn't have any form of access to the files of Alpinestein. Or tiny hill?

## Configure

Download the repo and extract or `git clone https://github.com/h8d13/LKFS`

```
sudo chmod +x run.sh
sudo ./run.sh
```

You can then just use it like a normal Alpine install `apk add micro-tetris`

(You can add `-vvv` if you want to see exactly where the 14kb of Tetris are going)
